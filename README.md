##### Why Qt5?

Qt 6 has been released,  but there are some bugs and problems of it. For example, I found on KDE, the menu of Qt 6 applications has disappeared, though I searched for the solution of the problem, I still found the problem is still exist.

The reason for build the Qt 5 varient of the Xe-Release is also there are so many changes in Gtk 4, and it is no static build of Gtk 4 provided by the official gtk team.

So, I decided to create this repository and the project, and I hope it will be a better build for Microsoft Windows.

##### The Xe-Release Kernel

Although this project use a different Library for GUI, the kernel will be same.
